# Category Theory for Machine Learning

Machine learning is a rapidly advancing field, with new techniques emerging frequenlty which showcase advances in performance and capabilities. Many have referred to the collection of machine learning architecures as a zoo, there are a wealth of varieties each with their own strengths and weakeness. 

Consequently, there has been a growing desire to construct a unifying theory of machine learning which encapsulates all these different architectures. Ultimately, with the goal of introducing rigour into machine learning research and providing a framework for future progress to be made.

Recently, researchers have been attracted to the realm of abstract algebra to formalise many notions within machine learning. In these pages we discuss how category theroy is being applied to machine learning. Category theory concerns its self with describing the relationship between a collection of objects. It does not try to understand the individual object, but rather deals with the collection on "meta" level. It provides theories to how these collections of objects interact, then it is up to the individual to contextualise these ideas within a particular setting they are interested in. This later part has been the concern of some machine learning researchers who have started to describe concepts in machine learning using the powerful framework provided by category theory.
