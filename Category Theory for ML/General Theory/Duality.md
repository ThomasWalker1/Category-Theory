**Definition**
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. The opposite category $\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}$ has
- The same objects as $\mathcal{C}$
- A morphism $f^{{\text{op}}}$ in $\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}$ for each morphism $f$ in $\mathcal{C}$ so that the domain of $f^{{\text{op}}}$ is the codomain of $f$ and the codomain of $f^{{\text{op}}}$ is the domain of $f$

$1^{{\text{op}}}_X$ is the identity for $X$ in $\text{C}^{{\text{op}}}$
We define $g^{{\text{op}}}\cdot f^{\text{op}}$ to be $(f\cdot g)^{\text{op}}$

We can think of $\mathcal{C}$ as essentially the same category as $\mathcal{C}$, just with the direction of morphisms reversed. All ideas in category theory regarding normal categories, have an equivalent (Dual) form that regards opposite categories instead.
